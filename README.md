# Ecommerce-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard
E-commerce Sales Analysis Dashboard Project
I worked on data cleaning, data modeling, creating DAX measures, and building interactive visualizations to transform raw data into meaningful analysis. The dashboard highlights:

* Sales performance and profit trends
* Best-selling products, categories, and sub-categories
* Regional sales distribution across states
* Customer contribution and payment behavior

The work on this project enhanced my skills in ETL, KPI design, and data storytelling, enabling me to deliver insights that support data-driven decisions.

The dashboard features:

* KPI Cards: Revenue, Profit, Quantity Sold, and Average Order Value
* Visuals:
      * Bar charts for profit by sub-category, sales by state, and customer contribution
      * Donut charts for category-wise sales and payment mode distribution
      * Clustered column chart for monthly profit trends
* Slicers: Quarter-wise and State-wise filters for dynamic exploration

* Screenshots / Demos:
       Dashboard looks like:
